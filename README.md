# Segment-Anything-Model-

This repository contains Meta Segment Anything Model (SAM) application for satellite imagery object detection. 

This example was initially developed in Google Colab, so it is just to copy and paste the content of the Python script to a Colab notebook, remove the indicated comments and run.

I recommend to activate Colab GPUs. For this simple image, SAM model toke over 10 minutes to run. Activating GPUs the runtime is drastically reduced.
